Questions from Athena slack...

Why did you make your project?

I've never made a full project in my own - I tend to be the artist in most projects I work on and so even though I'd previously made a visual novel, I didn't really fully absorb how it worked. As an artist I've always liked playing visual novels because they are packed with personality and amazing character design, you can really tell how much work the artists and programmers put into the characters, story, script and backgrounds.

I never had the chance to display my art before, so I thought what better way then to make a fun story with my art and characters? So really... I made this game to learn more about how the Ren'py game engine works and to have fuun displaying my art.

How did you make your project?

I'm making this game using the Ren'py game engine and programming with Python! I'm using VS code for my text editor and the plan is to upload the game to itch.io when it's complete...
I used Clip Studio Art and my mouse to make the sprites and backgrounds (but I used Sketchbook on my tablet to sketch then first)

What did you struggle with and what did you learn?

I struggled a lot with the sprite sizes... and of course learning how to use Ren'py in the first place. Like I said before, I'd never worked as the main programmer on a visual novel so I didn't really know how to use it at all. I was really happy when I managed to get my point system and the custom name input to work (as of now, the point system is a work in progress, but it's lookin good!!)... This was also my first time using Python for a project since I usually use HTML, CSS and JS but it was surprisingly easy to get going.
TL;DR... I struggled with everything until I learned how to use it (thank you so much youtube tutorials and reddit threads...)


Thanks a bunch for taking a look at my project!
